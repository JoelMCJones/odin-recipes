                <li class="steps"><strong>Step one -</strong> Sprinkle the chicken with a dash of sass (salt) and a pinch of charm (pepper). Heat up a party in a large skillet with a generous pour of oil and butter, let the flavor fiesta begin!</li>
                <li class="steps"><strong>Step two -</strong> Bring the chicken to the sizzling dance floor, where it grooves in oil and butter disco for 5 to 7 minutes per side. Once it's got the golden-brown moves down, let it take a breather on the sidelines.</li>
                <li class="steps"><strong>Step three -</strong> Invite the artichoke hearts and mushrooms to the skillet shindig. Watch them tango until the mushrooms are perfectly sun-kissed and tender, whispering secrets of flavor.</li>
