                <h1 class="steps-heading">5 Easy Steps</h1>
            
                <ol class="recipe-steps">
                    <li class="steps"><strong>Step one -</strong> Get down with the ground beef in a skillet dance-off over medium-high heat. Shake and stir until it's groovin' in evenly browned perfection.</li>
                    <li class="steps"><strong>Step two -</strong> Drain the grease and join the party by adding cream of mushroom soup, tomatoes, and uncooked rice. It's a saucy, soupy shindig.</li>
                    <li class="steps"><strong>Step three -</strong> Throw a lid on the pan, let the flavors jam over low heat. Stir occasionally and let the rice rock and roll for about 15 minutes until it's cooked and ready to party.</li>
                    <li class="steps"><strong>Step four -</strong> Crank up the heat, it's time for the oven's broiler to shine. Transfer the skillet sensation to a casserole dish. Cover it up with a cheesy blanket, creating a layer that's about to melt hearts.</li>
                    <li class="steps"><strong>Step five -</strong> Broil until the cheese is all melty and toasty. Season with a dash of salt and pepper, tune in to taste, and get ready to enjoy the flavorful groove!</li>
